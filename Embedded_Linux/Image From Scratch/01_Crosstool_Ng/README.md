# Customized ARM Toolchain with Crosstool-ng

üîß This guide walks through configuring and using a customized ARM toolchain with Crosstool-NG.

## Installation Steps

```bash
# 1- Clone the crosstool-ng repo
git clone [crosstool-ng-repo]

# 2- Checkout to the version needed
git checkout [version]

# 3- Bootstrap
./bootsrap

# 4- Configure with local directory
./configure --enable-local

# 5- Build 
make
sudo make install
```

## Using the Crosstool-ng

```bash
# Get available preconfigured samples
./ct-ng list-samples

# See what is configured
./ct-ng show-<sample_you_chosed>

# Edit configuration (menu is based on Linux Kernel menu config)
./ct-ng menuconfig

# After configuring, build the toolchain
./ct-ng build
```

## Notes
> The toolchain will be in x-tools directory in your home folder.

Naming convention for toolchains based on GNU is:

CPU-VENDOR-KERNEL-OS

- mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu
- arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabihf

> EABI: Extended Application Binary Interface

> HF: Hard-Float (Use hardware FPU)

## Customized ARM Toolchain Overview

üõ†Ô∏è This task documents the configuration and setup of a customized ARM toolchain using Crosstool-NG.

### Toolchain Configuration

1. **Bootstrap**: Set up the environment.
2. **Configure**: Checked all dependencies with `./configure --enable-local`.
3. **Make**: Generated the Makefile for Crosstool-NG.
4. **List Samples**: Listed all supported microcontrollers with `./ct-ng list-samples`.
5. **Configuration**: Configured the desired microcontroller with `./ct-ng [microcontroller]`.
6. **Menuconfig**: Configured the toolchain options using `./ct-ng menuconfig`.
7. **Build**: Built the toolchain with `./ct-ng build`.

### Sysroot Explanation

A sysroot serves as the root filesystem for the target system during cross-compilation. It contains all necessary files and libraries required to build and run software for the target architecture.

### Binutil Explanation

Binutils are a collection of binary utilities, including programs for assembling, linking, and manipulating binary files for various architectures.

## Conclusion

By customizing the ARM toolchain and understanding the sysroot and binutils, developers can create efficient and optimized software for ARM-based embedded systems.
