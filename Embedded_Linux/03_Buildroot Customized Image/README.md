# Crafting BuildRoot Packages üì¶

Forge your personalized package and infuse it into the very fabric of your BuildRoot creation.

1. Embark on the journey by creating a folder for your package.

```bash
mkdir -p ./package/simpleapp/src
```

2. Craft your source file, the essence of your creation.

```bash
touch simpleapp.c && vim simpleapp.c
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	printf("Hi People\r\n");
}
```

3. Forge the Makefile, the arcane script that breathes life into your creation.

```bash
touch Makefile && vim Makefile
```

```makefile
.PHONY: clean
.PHONY: simpleapp

simpleapp: simpleapp.c
        $(CC) -g -Wall $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

clean:
        -rm simpleapp
```

4. Craft a package definition to usher your creation into the realm of BuildRoot.

```bash
touch simpleapp.mk && vim simpleapp.mk
```

```makefile
################################################################################
#
# simpleapp package
#
################################################################################

SIMPLEAPP_VERSION = 1.0
SIMPLEAPP_SITE = package/simpleapp/src
SIMPLEAPP_SITE_METHOD = local

define SIMPLEAPP_BUILD_CMDS
    $(MAKE) CC="$(TARGET_CC)" LD="$(TARGET_LD)" -C $(@D)
endef

define SIMPLEAPP_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS
    $(INSTALL) -D -m 0755 $(@D)/simpleapp  $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin
endef

$(eval $(generic-package))
```

5. Engrave your package's name in the annals of BuildRoot's configuration.

```bash
touch Config.in && vim Config.in
```

```bash
config BR2_PACKAGE_SIMPLEAPP
    bool "simpleapp"
    help
        simpleapp package.
```

6. Link your package to the grand tapestry of BuildRoot's package configuration.

```bash
vim ./package/Config.in
```

```makefile
menu "SIMPLEAPP Packages"
    source "package/simpleapp/Config.in"
endmenu
```

7. Infuse your package into the very fabric of BuildRoot's being.

```bash
cd buildroot
make menuconfig
# Enable your package under target package configuration
make -j8
```

# Sage Advice and Mystical Insights üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Unravel the secrets of U-Boot through the creation of configuration files in the boot partition:
